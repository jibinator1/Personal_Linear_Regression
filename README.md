# Personal_Linear_Regression

In order to understand how linear regression works, I recreated linear regression without using any libraries that may skip the process. I created the 3 main functions for my linear regression: fit, predict, and accuracy where I recieved an accuracy of 92.83% from the linear regression I created. I used gradient descent to fit the model.
